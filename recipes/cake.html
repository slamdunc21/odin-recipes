    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A chewy, fudgy, brownie that is easy to make. This is great because it uses things that you may already have on hand.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
            <li>2¼ cups sifted cake flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ cup vegetable shortening</li>
            <li>1½ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) bottle red food coloring</li>
            <li>1 fluid ounce water </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>2 cups butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>

        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 9-inch cake pans. In a bowl, sift cake flour with baking soda.</li>
                <li>Mash the vegetable shortening with 1 1/2 cup of sugar in a large bowl until thoroughly combined, and stir in the eggs, one at a time. Pour the red food coloring into a small bowl, and fill the empty food coloring container with water; add the water to the food coloring. Stir in cocoa powder to make a paste, and mix the paste into the shortening mixture.</li>
                <li>Stir the buttermilk, salt, vanilla extract, and apple cider vinegar in a bowl, and mix into the colored shortening mixture, alternating with the flour mixture, until well combined. Scrape the batter into the prepared cake pans.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow the cakes to cool completely.</li>
                <li>To make frosting, whisk together the milk and all-purpose flour in a saucepan until the mixture is free of lumps, and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture is thick, about 1 minute. Pour the thickened sauce into a mixing bowl, and chill until completely cooled, at least 30 minutes. When cold, place the butter into the mixture, and beat with an electric mixer to combine; add the vanilla extract and 2 cups of sugar to the bowl, and beat with the mixer set on Medium speed until the frosting is light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</li>

            </ol>
    
     <h4>Cook's Note</h4>
     As a substitute for buttermilk, you can also make sour milk by adding about 2 tablespoons of vinegar into liquid measuring cup, then add milk to make 1 cup.
